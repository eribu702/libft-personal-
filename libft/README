Welcome to my libft library!!
To use, copy the libft folder into the folder of the file you are trying to use the library from,
run "make lib" in the library and be sure to have the (#include "./libft/libft.h") included at the top of your main file.
enjoy!

commands:

make lib: compile all files and clean, leaving libft.a library file
make re: recompile
make: compile all files
make clean: clean object files
